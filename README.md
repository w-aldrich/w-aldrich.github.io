***School Projects***
- [Multi Threaded Chatroom Server with Android Application](https://github.com/w-aldrich/schoolHighlights/tree/master/ChatRoom)
  - Created a multithreaded web server that implements HTTP and Web socket protocols on top of TCP sockets. Utilizes JSON formatting for communication between server and both web client and Android client.
- [Multi Threaded Server to Client File Transfer utilizing SSL](https://github.com/w-aldrich/schoolHighlights/tree/master/MySSL)
  - Implemented a SSL Handshake between client and server utilizing self signed certificates for authentication. Once a secure connection is established, Server sends an encrypted version of a specified file to the Client then closes the connection. Utilizes RSA encryption for the transfer of nonces and the encryption for the file.
- [Encrypted File System](https://github.com/w-aldrich/schoolHighlights/tree/master/encryptedFilesystem)
  - Utilized FUSE to write a pass through file system in user space. Encrypted files contain 16 bytes of a random salt along with the encrypted version of the file. When script is running allows for a directory of unencrypted information for user to look at.

***Personal Projects***
- [Cheap Flights Web Scraper](https://github.com/w-aldrich/PersonalPythonScripts/blob/master/cheapFlightsWebCrawler.py)
  - This web scraper utilized Selenium and BeautifulSoup to navigate web pages, submit form data, scrape the HTML and parse out the information to find the cheapest flights in a given date range.
